# Week 03 Assignment
This assignment acts as a calculator to find the shipping price of any item depending on the destination, whether it is fragile or not, and the original price. It also outputs the whole calculation to a file entitled "Order.txt". This could be very useful to people who wan't to know their total price of shipping before they confirm their decision.
